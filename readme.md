# Jasuutu Screeps Plan

## Goal

The goal of this project is to try to be able to be able to have a fully coordinated civilization with the least amout of processing power required for it to function. As of now, I currently think that haveing a small amount of objects that need to make the descisions then giving orders to highly specialized individuals is the way to go. This way, each individual unit won't need to make the same computation. Instead, there will be overseers that will make the descisions for them then tell the individuals what to do and where to do it. This way, the overseers won't need to know how something is done, just a general idea of what each task does and the individual will know how to actually perform the task. Likewise, the individual won't need to keep track of everything that going on around them and they will just need to focus on the task that they were given.
